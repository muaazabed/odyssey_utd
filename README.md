<div align="center">An often overlooked aspect of the University of Texas at Dallas is its campus. UTD Odyssey aims to bring more appreciation for the buildings of UTD. UTD Odyssey is a mobile application created with Flutter that uses the Google Maps API to give a daily location for users to visit and take a photo at, creating a community of odysseers that come to appreciate the finer spaces of UTD. Stay tuned for future updates!</div>
